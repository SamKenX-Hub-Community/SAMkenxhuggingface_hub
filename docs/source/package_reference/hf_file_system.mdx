# Filesystem API

The `HfFileSystem` class provides a pythonic file interface to the Hugging Face Hub based on [`fssepc`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## HfFileSystem

`HfFileSystem` is based on [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so it is compatible with most of the APIs that it offers. For more details, check out [our guide](../guides/hf_file_system) and the fsspec's [API Reference](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem).
